# FruitShop

I've made everything required in the exercise but I could not finish the recipe generation.
I've tried to resolve the offers in the most flexible way, avoiding hardcoded data. 
The only remaining point of the exercise to complete is the part of the recipe generation where the program should calculate the offers applied and print them.

Sorry for the inconveniences and thanks for your time.

Best regards.
